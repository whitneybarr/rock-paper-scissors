# rock-paper-scissors
I created a rock, paper scissors game which plays 10 rounds and declares the winner.

The initial version of this game was played in the console log. I added a basic ui with guidance from The Odin Project, then I decided to continue building on the UI. 

Creating the UI and making everything update correctly based on player actions was challenging, but I feel like I learned a lot.
